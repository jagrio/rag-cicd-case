# The gap the alarms leave.
#
# Alarms only fire on metrics, so they cover a task set that serves badly. They say nothing when a
# deployment is reversed for any other reason — the gate voting FAILED, the circuit breaker giving
# up on a task that never starts — because in those cases no traffic was ever served and no metric
# ever moved. Those are the events worth waking someone for, and until this rule existed they were
# visible only to whoever happened to read the pipeline log.
#
# ECS already announces them on the default event bus. Nothing was listening.
